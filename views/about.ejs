        <strong>AI Credit News</strong> is your trusted source for news, analysis, and insights at the intersection
        of artificial intelligence and the financial services industry—specifically credit scoring, banking,
        lending, income verification, and related technologies.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The world of AI in finance is evolving rapidly. New machine learning models are transforming how
        creditworthiness is assessed, how fraud is detected, and how banks serve their customers. Our mission
        is to make this complex landscape accessible to everyone—from industry professionals to curious learners.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>

      <h3>1. News Curation</h3>
      <p>
        Our automated systems monitor RSS feeds from leading technology, finance, and banking publications.
        AI filters and categorizes articles based on their relevance to AI applications in credit and banking,
        making it easy to discover what matters most.
      </p>

      <h3 id="original-content">2. Original Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to curating external content, we produce <strong>original analysis articles</strong> on key trends,
        product launches, market dynamics, and regulatory developments. These pieces are clearly marked with an

        <h4>Our Editorial Process</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Research:</strong> AI systems gather and synthesize information from multiple sources including news, regulatory filings, market data, and industry reports.</li>
          <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The AI generates draft articles that provide original insights, not just summaries of existing content.</li>
          <li><strong>Human Review:</strong> Our editorial team reviews all AI-generated content before publication, ensuring accuracy, fairness, and journalistic standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Publication:</strong> Approved articles are published with clear attribution as AI Credit News original content.</li>
        </ol>

      <p>
        <strong>Why AI-assisted journalism?</strong> By combining AI's ability to rapidly process information with human editorial judgment,
        we can provide timely, well-researched analysis that would be impossible for a small team to produce manually.
        We believe in transparency about our methods and clearly distinguish our original content from curated articles.
